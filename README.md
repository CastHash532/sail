# sail

`sail` is a universal workflow for reproducible, project-defined development environments.

It can be used as a command line, or through the browser with
[the Sail extension](https://sail.dev/docs/concepts/browser-extension/).

## Features

- **No more "It works on my machine"**, everyone working on the same project is working in the same environment.
- **Stop duplicating effort**, source-control and collaborate on the environment.
- **Instant set-up**, open an IDE for a project straight from GitHub or GitLab.

## Documentation

Documentation is available at [https://sail.dev/docs](https://sail.dev/docs/introduction/). 

Or, you can read it in it's markdown form at [site/content/docs.](site/content/docs)
